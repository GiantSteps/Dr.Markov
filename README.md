# Markov-Drums
#### Generative MIDI drum loops in style

In this repository I will include the code to create generative MIDI drum loops in-a-style which I am developing as part of my PhD research.

To run the Markov-Drums you need a recent a pd-vanilla distribution (http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html) with the following externals:

*cyclone zexy freeverb~ (bpm) (sprintf)*

We suggest you to download the dependencies via the deken plugin (https://github.com/pure-data/deken). External objects are always referenced as such in the patch, so you don't need to declare anything in advance.
